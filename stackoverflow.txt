Hi,

I have three tables via many-to-many-association: Supermarket, Product and Supply.
Each Supermarket can hold many products and each product can be sold in many supermarkets. The association is build via the Supply-model.


    class Supermarket < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessible :name, :address, :products_attributes
    
      has_many :supplies
      has_many :products, :through => :supplies
    
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :products
    end

    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessible :name, :supermarkets_attributes
      
      has_many :supplies,
      has_many :supermarkets, :through => :supplies
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :supermarkets
    end

    class Supply < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessible :supermarket_id, :product_id
    
      belongs_to :supermarket
      belongs_to :product
    
    end

I have created the scaffolds and populated the Supermarket-table.
In my Product form, i want to use one (or more) drop-down-menu(s) to select the correspondent Supermarket-name(s). Goal is to create a new product while also creating the association via the Supply-table.
What should the code look like in form and/or controller?
